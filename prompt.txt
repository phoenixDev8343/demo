Help me create a Java program to monitor CPU usage. Break it into small steps:

Initialization: Provide the minimal Java code to set up CPU monitoring (imports and setup), without fetching or calculating usage.

Once I get this part, Iâ€™ll ask for the next step.

Please give me the code for CPU initialization only.
